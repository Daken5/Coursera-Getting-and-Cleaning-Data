#Introduction
This repository contains my project for the Coursera course - "Getting and Cleaning data"

#About this script and resulting data set
This script will combine, label and extract the mean and standard deviation variables from the original "UCI HAR Dataset"
This script must be run in the working folder which is an extract of the original "UCI HAR Dataset"
The resulting data set is labeled "UCI_summary" and is written into a tab-deliminated txt file called "UCI_tidy_data.txt" which is included in the repository
#About the code book
The CodeBook.md file describes the processes in the "run_analysis.R"" script
